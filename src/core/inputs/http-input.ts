   * - body: (object) - The received BODY as an object.
   * - query: (object) - An object that has all the query string items.
   * - params?: (optional Array<string>) - This is the PATH of the request.

   * Note that to respond to the HTTP Request, once the rules engine pass is complete,

   * - Leave facts.httpResponseAction set to null or undefined. The caller will receive an empty

   * - Set facts.httpResponseAction to an object that conforms to <ICoreHttpResponseAction>.

   * - Set facts.httpResponseAction to any object at all. The caller will receive the object
   *   passed here and an http status 200.

   *   <ICoreHttpResponseAction> implements Coronado Bridge's <OutboundResponse> and includes:
   *   - body: object - an object to return as the HTTP body of the response.
   *   - status: number - an HTTP status code for th response.
